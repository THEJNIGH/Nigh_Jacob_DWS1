		<a href = "index.html"> Back to home page </a>
		<p> There are tons of strange festivals around the world. Some are done with cheese; 
			some are done with frog legs. None the less these festivals are for people to
			come out and have fun with other people that find these specific festivals 
			interesting. These festivals are meant to me fun and for everyone to enjoy them.
