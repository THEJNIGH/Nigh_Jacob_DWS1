		<h2> History </h2>
		<p id = "history">The history of the hookah dates back to as far back as the 1560's. At this time 
		tobacco was know to cause health issues. Thus, the water pipe was born. The hookah
		was to purify the harming effects that it did on the human body. It was also well
		known with the indian aristocrats and gentry.</p>
		<blockquote> "Oh! hookah of the magic bowl,
			Thou dost bring me greatest pleasure,
			Who likes not thee, hath not a soul,
			And can know of joy no measure.
			<br />
			Thy fragrance brings me visions bright--
			Dispels the shadows of the night."
			From the book Medical Sentinel.
